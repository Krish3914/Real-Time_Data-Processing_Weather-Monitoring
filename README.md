## Overview

The Weather Monitoring App is a real-time service designed to provide weather data for major Indian cities. This application allows users to retrieve current weather information, including temperature, humidity, and weather conditions, as well as access historical weather data stored in a MongoDB database. Built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js), the app fetches data from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays it in a user-friendly interface. Users can view detailed weather information for specific cities and monitor temperature trends over time.

This structure provides a clear separation of concerns, making it easier to manage and maintain the application.

## Design Choices

1. **MERN Stack**: We chose the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack for its flexibility and JavaScript ecosystem.

2. **Real-time Updates**: The system fetches weather data at configurable intervals to provide near real-time updates.

3. **Daily Summaries**: We generate daily summaries to provide aggregated insights, which are useful for trend analysis.

4. **Alerting System**: The alerting system is designed to be configurable and can be easily extended to include more complex conditions.

5. **Visualization**: We use Chart.js for creating visual representations of the weather data, making it easier for users to understand trends.

6. **Modular Architecture**: The project is structured with separate components and services for better organization and maintainability.

## üöÄ Features

- ### Display Real-Time Weather Data:
  - Weather conditions, temperature, humidity, and more for current locations and major metro cities.
  - Uses Axios to fetch data from weather APIs.
- ### Real-Time Data Updates:
  - Automatically updates weather data every 10 minutes using setInterval().
  - Handles asynchronous data fetch with async/await in the JavaScript event loop.
- ### Temperature Conversion:
  - Converts temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin using an O(1) time complexity formula.
    
- ### Data Storage and Analysis:
  - Stores weather data in MongoDB for future analysis and visualization.
  - Enables historical data plotting, such as temperature trends over time.
- ### Weather Summaries:
  - Generates summaries using the Gemini-1.5 Pro Model, selected for its faster and more efficient output compared to Flash.

- ### Interactive Data Visualization:
  - Displays temperature trends in a Line Graph using Chart.js and react-chartjs-2.
  - The X-axis represents the time of data updates, while the Y-axis shows the temperature.
- ### Security:
  - Implements IP hashing to mitigate DDoS attacks.
  - Requests exceeding a threshold from the same IP trigger a 2-second response delay.
 
- ### Alert Thresholds:
  - Users can set temperature thresholds and receive alerts when the temperature exceeds those limits.
  - Uses EmailJS to send alert notifications.
- ### Additional Weather Information:
  - Provides extra data such as humidity, wind speed, minimum and maximum temperatures, and average temperature.

- ### Responsive Design:
  - Ensures the website is fully responsive and adapts seamlessly to all screen sizes.

## API Endpoints

### Get Weather Data for All Cities

- **Endpoint:** `GET /weather-data`
- **Description:** Fetches the latest weather data for all monitored cities. Returns up to the last 10 entries for each city.
- **Response:**
  ```json
  [
    {
      "name": "City Name",
      "country": "Country Code",
      "temp": "Temperature",
      "feels_like": "Feels Like Temperature",
      "temp_min": "Minimum Temperature",
      "temp_max": "Maximum Temperature",
      "timestamp": "Timestamp of the data",
      "createdAt": "Time of creation",
      "updatedAt": "Time of updation"
    }
  ]
  ```

### Get Weather Data for a Specific City

- **Endpoint:** `GET /weather-data/city`
- **Description:** Fetches the latest weather data for a specific city. Returns up to the last 10 entries for the specified city.
- **Parameters:**
  - `city`: The name of the city for which weather data is requested (case-sensitive).
- **Response:**
  ```json
  [
    {
      "name": "City Name",
      "country": "Country Code",
      "temp": "Temperature",
      "feels_like": "Feels Like Temperature",
      "temp_min": "Minimum Temperature",
      "temp_max": "Maximum Temperature",
      "timestamp": "Timestamp of the data",
      "createdAt": "Time of creation",
      "updatedAt": "Time of updation"
    }
  ]
  ```

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository.

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/SaurabhSingh2115/Weather-Monitoring-App.git
   ```

2. Install the dependencies for both the backend and frontend.

   **server/**

   ```
   cd Weather-Monitoring-App/server
   npm install
   ```

   **client/**

   ```
   cd ../client
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the **backend** application.

   **server/**

   ```
   nodemon index.js
   ```

4. Start the **frontend** application in a new terminal.

   **client/**

   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

   For the time being, I have provided my OpenWeatherMap API key and MongoDB connection string in the code. It is better to use your own and store them inside a .env file for security reasons.
